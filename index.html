                <h3>Low Level Games Programming // C++</h3>
                <p>
                    Ray tracing is a technique used in computer graphics, to render shadows, reflections and refract lights. Classic ray tracing shoots
                    invisible rays from the camera and traces the path as they bounce from object to object.<br> The main areas of this project were
                    the optimizations techniques through the use of kernel threads and user level threads, file reading and writing optimizations, and the low
                    level memory managenent. <br> For the memory manager, I made use of the C style operators "malloc" and "free", that are used to allocate
                    and deallocate chunks of memory. The memory manager helps developers to find memory leaks easier, or check if any variable is overwriten.
                    We can create a header and a footer for the memory we create, that way we can declare an unused variable in the header and footer, and
                    check if that variable has changed at any point during the program.<br> The optimizations techniques I used are mainly based on
                    threads, and Parallel tasking. If the program runs sequentional, with only one thread working on all images, the program is slow.
                    Adding more worker threads helps with the performance of the program.<br>
                    Sequentional time: 120 seconds<br>/-/-/-/-/-//-/-/-/-/-//-/-/-/-/-//-/-/-/-/-//-/-/-/-/-/<br>
                    Threads time: 9 seconds

                <h3>3D // DirectX11 (Physics) // C++ // HLSL</h3>
                <p>
                    The physics system I managed to create is a representation of forces applied to objects
                    of different masses. The first cube has a thrust force applied to it from below, that
                    launches it upwards when arrives in position(0,0,0), and another brake force that is applied
                    in the opposite direction, so only gravity can affect it and bring it back to ground.<br>
                    The second cube is a representation for Quaternion rotations. <br>
                    Cube 3 and cube 4 are a representation of velocity and acceleration being applied.
                    Cube 3 will move at the same speed whenever the button is pressed. Cube 4 will start moving
                    slowly, and then increase its speed over time. <br>
                    Cube 5 can be moved by player input, and can apply forces to the other game objects in the
                    scene. <br>
                    There are 2 types of collision detection implemented. AABB or axis aligned bounding box, which can be
                    visible on screen through the collision resolution applied to other objects, and sphere collision which
                    can be seen in the output window.
                </p>

                <h3>3D // DirectX11 (Graphics) // C++ // HLSL</h3>
                <p>
                    DirectX is a collection of APIs that you can use to create games and high-performance graphics applications.
                    DirectX11 graphics includes support for both 3D and 2D graphics. Direct3D is an industry standard, low-level
                    graphics API, used to draw primitives through the rendering pipeline, and enables us to render 3D worlds
                    using 3D hardware acceleration. The main competitor to Direct3D is OpenGL, because both APIs are commonly
                    used to create graphics for Windows PC.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The DirectX project I managed to make is a representation of a 3D scene, that contains 4 objects.
                    I made a real life cube out of paper to be able to visualize and understand the vertices.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On paper, I have drawn the wall's vertex coordinates, normals, and texture coordinates. The floor is scaling
                    up and down constantly, due to the time period passed since the last frame (delta time); At first, I implemented
                    the scaling into the shader calculations, all objects in the scene suffering the transformation.

                <p>
                    For the airplane, we have been given an OBJ loader and the airplane model.
                    The pyramid is rotating around a pivot of coordinates(0,0,0).

                <p>
                    For the lighting calculations, we needed to have a look at the vertex and fragment shaders, and alter
                    which variables get passed in the constant buffer, and use them to calculate the ambient, diffuse and specular
                    lights. Intellisense does not recognise HLSL code, which makes it harder to find errors. Towards the end of the
                    semester, we found that there is an extension that can be applied to Visual Studio, that helps developers
                    find errors easier.

                <h3>Task based software engineering // C# // WPF // F#</h3>
                <p>
                    This project was about designing a C# application that can deal with a large amount of data
                    query the data and make calculations based of the required data type. <br>
                    the project presents is a simple data reading algorithm, which calculates the sum between elements of a list,
                    depending on what the consumer wants to know.<br> For example, the consumer might want to find the cost of all orders available in the
                    supplied data, or the cost of the orders for a supplier type, in a week for a specific location. To do the calculation for every order,
                    a “Parallel.ForEach” does the job, if it has the reference to the correct set of data.<br> The easy way to do it is to use the correct
                    override method and reference the “orders” list where the data is stored and use a “Lambda” expression for performing the equation
                    for sum. The problem comes when different threads try to access the same variable at the same time, and different sums are shown at
                    the end of each run.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started with a console output, where the user can select what information he wants to access, then
                    I implemented the functionality to a WPF GUI.

                <h3>Mario // C++</h3>
                <p>
                    In the first year, during the second semester at Staffordshire University, we have been required to create a 2D game in C++,
                    using SDL 2.0, that is simmilar to Mario Bros. A simple 2D game, with different levels,
                    enemies, tasks, or with an implemention of textures or animations. I managed to create a similar
                    experience with the actual game, by using similar textures,
                    but I have added my original ideas, such as a puzzle(level 2), and pixel art textures created by me.(grass, brick)

                <h3>Pacman // C++</h3>
                <p>
                    In the first year, I learned bit-by-bit how to create a 2D game, a representative game, "Pacman".
                    I remember that when I made pacman move up, down, left, and right,
                    I was so excited to learn how to improve the project, by implementing the ghosts, the menus.
                    For this project we used the library S2D, which helped us with the window handling,
                    input controls, audio, and drawing objects in 2D. To draw the map, I used pen and paper to
                    get the correct coordinates for the walls, and set the munchies on positions where the
                    player can get achieve them.

                <h3>Server-Chat architecture // WPF // C#</h3>
                <p>
                    WPF (WINDOWS PRESENTATION FOUNDATION), is a UI framework that creates desktop applications, or a server-client architecture.
                    The framework has a similar interface experience with other .NET frameworks, so if you have previously worked with applications that
                    are using ASP.net, Windows Forms, XML or HTML, the programming experience should be familiar. Syntactically, the language might
                    be slightly different, for some of the wording, but the layout should be common. WPF uses the Extensible Application Markup
                    Language (XAML), and can be used to display graphics, can be used to layout the features that you might want to implement.
                    WPF can be used for a lot of different areas, such as chat communication, 2D and 3D graphics, the relationship between video and
                    animation, data binding, styles and control templates. <br>
                    At first I started with a simple console application, where a person was able to communicate with a computer.
                </p>
                <img width:"100%" src="images/chatServer.png" alt="" />
                <p>
                    Then I made a simple GUI, with multiple instances (chats), where you could enter a name and connect to the server.
                    Messages that are sent by a user can be seen across the other clients.

                <h3>3D // OpenGL // C++</h3>
                <p>
                    3D OpenGL is a pretty hard to understand framework, in which you can add, change, move objects around the scene,
                    objects that can have different colors, textures, dimensions,
                    or objects that can have their size changed from the scene.	Lights and materials are important features for
                    a game scene, features that can give your game a better perspective of a scene.
                    OpenGL can be used to create a custiomizable game engine.

                <p>
                    The idea behind this project was that I had been assigned to replace a specific
                    generic sentence with another similar one, in more than 500 ".xls" files. Windows
                    lets you open 10 files at a time, which takes time as well, in adition to the
                    time it would take to find and replace manually using the built in function.<br>
                    This is where I got the idea to create an application where you can select a folder
                    where you have all the Excel files, opens each one, and if there is any cell value
                    matching with the word we are looking for, it would change it to the other one.<br>
                    This app will save a lot of time, since it takes only a few seconds to open the folder
                    that contains all the files.<br>
                    The program creates a copy of each files in case anything goes wrong, so they can be
                    reverted to original.

                <h3>2. Generic website with included meeting scheduler</h3>
                <p>
                    I have been suggested a project idea to create a link that people can access
                    anytime and schedule a meeting with a doctor, barber, shop, or any other type of
                    business that requires meetings. To access the website
                    <a href="https://ionescualexandrum.github.io/SitePentruMa/">CLICK HERE</a><br>
                    The information on the website can be changed to match someone else's expectations,
                    as well as the structure or design of the website.<br><br>
                    The idea of this project was to implement the meeting scheduler, and to make
                    it work without direct access to the customer's email account. This way, I can create
                    a new workspace on my Microsoft account, asign the staff privileges based on the email
                    address and share the booking page with customers. <br>
                    The workspace has multiple options when it comes to assinging staff members,
                    sending emails to the staff and customers such as reminders or feedback.

                <p>
                    One of the skills I am most confident with, is programming in C++. I started with learning pseudocode for C++, in order to understand the logic behind the program.
                    When I got my PC during high-school, I had no idea what a computer was or how it worked, but the problem solving skills developed during my education years helped
                    me comprehend quickly the basics of the C++ programming. <br>
                    I started by learning simple management of different variables types, and then perfectining on manipulating different kinds of collections. The final exam for 
                    programming is structured in 3 sections. <br>
                    The first one is more about solving mathematical problems such as simple integer calculations, recursion, nodes, binary trees, and string manupulation, and 
                    with multiple choices with no solving required . <br>
                    The second section is more focused on solving and writing both C++ and pseudocode to achieve the wanted result. This secton is where the imagination and
                    problem solving skills are handy.<br>
                    The last section is focused heavily on writing object oriented code and optimization. It is very important to understand each problem's starting values and 
                    solving requirements.
